Assignment 1 solution:

1) Create 4 users as per problem statement with below names and passwords:
	Dev1->developer@1
	Dev2->developer@2
	Test1->tester@1
	Test2->tester@2
	
2) Create group 'Dev_Team' and add 'Dev1' and 'Dev2' usrers.

3) Create group 'Ops_Team' and add 'Dev1','Test1' and 'Test2' users.


Assignment 2 solution:

1) Create a policy with name 'Policy1' for full access of S3 and RDS, but we have to give limited access just to create an EC2 instance.

2) Therefore only give access to below actions:(EC2)

	a) tag->DescribeTags;CreateTags
	b) images->DescribeImages
	c) instancetype->DescribeInstanceTypes
	d) key->CreateKeyPair;DescribeKeyPairs
	e) vpc->DescribeVpcs
	f) subnet->DescribeSubnets
	g) securitygroup->DescribeSecurityGroups;DescribeSecurityGroupRules
	h) volumes->DescribeVolumes;CreateVolume;AttachVolume
	i) interface->DescribeNetworkInterfaces;CreateNetworkInterface;AttachNetworkInterface
	j) instance->RunInstances
	
3) Attach the above created policy to 'Dev_Team' group.

4) You can confirm that policy is working by logging into aws console with 'Dev1' credentials and launching an ec2 instance.

5) Create a policy named 'Policy2' for full access of Cloudwatch and Billing, only allowing all the list actions for EC2 and S3 resources.(Divide policy into 2-a & 2-b)

6) Attach the above created policy to 'Ops_Team' group.

7) You can confirm that policy is working by logging into aws console with 'Dev1' credentials and checking above provided access.


Assignment 3 solution:

1) Create a role using ARN of 'Dev1' and 'Dev2' users by defining them in trust policy defined below.

2) Custom trust policy for above role would be:

	{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "Statement1",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
			    "AWS":["arn:aws:iam::094838594048:user/Dev1","arn:aws:iam::094838594048:user/Dev2"]
			},
			"Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
		}
	]
}

3) Then attach permission policies i.e, 'AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess' and 'AmazonVPCFullAccess' and create a role with name 'DynamoVPC'.

4) To verify if the role defined is functioning as expected log into console with Dev1 or Dev2 creds.

5) After logging in switch to 'DynamoVPC' role and try creating a table in dynamodb if you are able to create it succesfully then it's working as expected.

->Only Dev1 and Dev2 can switch to DynamoVPC role as defined in trust policy.
->This is a temporary access given to users and can only be accessed by switching to appropriate role defined.
->After switching to particular role the users will only be authorized to access resources defined in that particular role.
->They will not be able to access resources defined in policies which were previously attached to groups of the users.
