Assignment 1 Solution:

1) Create an EC2 instance in specified region and do not forget to allow SSH,HTTP protocols as these are required security groups for further operations.

2) sudo apt-get update

3) sudo apt-get install nginx
 
4) To verify that we have sucessfully installed nginx, copy Public IPv4 address(44.202.146.151) under "Details" tab and paste in chrome.

5) cd var/www/html

6) ls -l

7) sudo nano index.nginx-debian.html

8) Edit the html file to display desired content and check the IP address if that's reflecting appropriate content
													OR
9) sudo rm index.nginx-debian.html
   sudo nano index.html with below code and provide required permissions.
   <html>
   <h1> Hello World </h1>
   </html>
   
10) Refresh the page to see contents in index.html in your web browser.


Assignment 2 Solution:

1) Launch an EC2 instance in an AZ.

2) Create an EBS volume of required capacity in same AZ as created EC2 instance.

3) Attach created volume to appropriate EC2 instance and verify the same under "Storage" tab by slecting EC2 instance.

4) Select Modify volume option in Actions dropdownbox to edit the size of created volume.(You can only increase volume)


Assignment 3 Solution:

1) Create multiple EC2 instances with different OS as required by adding SSH,HTTP and NFS as required security groups(Task3reqSG).

2) Create an EFS storage and under "Network acess" tab make sure security group(Task3reqSG) is selected for all "Mount targets".

3) Launch all the instances and follow below steps:

   sudo apt-get install nfs-common (or) sudo yum install nfs-utils
   
   sudo mkdir efs
   
   sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-060bf7ae1234103e1.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ efs
   (The above command is available when you navigate inside created EFS and click on "Attach" button)
   
   cd efs
   
   sudo nano testmount.txt
   (Try the above command in any one EC2 instance and check in another EC2 instance if the file is created)
   
   
Case Study Solution:

1) Launch an EC2 instance in N-virginia region with linux O/S with appropriate configuration.

2) Create an image of the launced instance.

3) The image created in above step will be availavble in 'AMI's' under "Images".

4) Navigate to created AMI and click on 'Copy AMI' to copy AMI to desired region(Oregon region).

5) Build two EBS volumes and attach them to the instance in us-east-1 (N. Virginia) region.

6) Delete one volume after detaching it and extend the size of other volume.

7) Take backup of the EBS volume  using "Snapshots" which will be stored in an S3 bucket.
